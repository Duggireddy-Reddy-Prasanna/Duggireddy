title: "Paper on dislocation assisted phase separation published"
---

Our paper on the phase field study of dislocation assisted phase separation has finally been published! 

In this study, we have used the phase field dislocation dynamics simulations coupled with a 
composition field to study the microstructure evolution around stationary dislocations. 

The most interesting observation from this study was the formation of localised spinodal domains 
along the dislocation line, in systems having a miscibility gap, with average compositions 
outside the spinodal limit! This was due to the faster pipe diffusivty along the dislocation, 
which aids the rapid growth of spinodal flucatuations along the dislocation line. 

In addition, we also found, to our surprise, that phase separation via concurrent nucleation and 
spinodal is also possible in systems with intersecting dislocations. The nucleation happens, as 
you might have guessed, at the dislocation intersection, with the spinodal fluctuations taking 
off slightly later. 

We have also mapped the parameter space, in terms of compositions, dislocation-solute (elastic) 
interaction and the pipe mobility, at which nucleation and spinodal-dominated phase separation 
dominate respectively.

The paper was published after a long review of a year and 5 months. Extermely happy that we could make it.
