title: "Manuscript accepted - Importance of electron phonon interactions in determining stability of semiconductor polymorphs"
---

Another paper that has been under review for more than a year finally gets accepted for punlication in ACS Omega. 

The paper is on the importance of electron phonon interactions in determining the 
most stable polytype of materials such as Si, C and SiC. In addition to the DFT total energy, which is the energy obtained conventionally by density functional theory, other energy terms such as the van der Waals and zero point vibrational energy terms also may influence the stability order of different polymorphs. 

In this work,
