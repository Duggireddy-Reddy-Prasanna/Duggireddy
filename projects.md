#### **Dislocation assisted phase separation**

Using a phase field dislocation dynamics model, we look at the evolution of phases around edge dislocations in an 
elastically homogeneous and isotropic system with a miscibility gap. The presence of straight dislocation 
in such a system with a homogeneous initial composition (outside the spinodal limit) would results in a segregation
driven precipitation at the dislocation. The precipitate would look like a cylinder with a cardioid cross-section 
for a straight dislocation.

</p>

However, we are missing an important piece of physics here, namely, the faster diffusivity of solutes along a dislocation, 
known in literature as ["pipe diffusion"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0001616064902202). By assuming the atomic mobility as a function of the dislocation field, 
we incorporated the faster pipe diffusivity in our model using a formulation 
by [Zhu et al.](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.60.3564). 


And voila! 
Instead of a straight cylindrical precipitate, we see blobs of particles formed by the growth of a composition 
instability along the straight dislocation. In other words, a localised spinodal at the dislocation line, in a system 
with an initial composition outside the spinodal limits.
