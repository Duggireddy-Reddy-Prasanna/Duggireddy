#### Dislocation assisted phase separation

Using a phase field dislocation dynamics model, we look at the evolution of phases around edge dislocations in an 
elastically homogeneous and isotropic system with a miscibility gap. The presence of straight dislocation 
in such a system with a homogeneous initial composition (outside the spinodal limit) would results in a segregation
driven precipitation. This precipitation occurs due to
