Hello there. You have reached the homepage of Arjun Varma R. 

Arjun is a PhD candidate at the Department of Metallurgical 
Engineering and Materials Science at the Indian Institute of 
Technology Bombay. He uses computational techniques such as 
phase field modelling, discrete dislocation dynamics and 
atomistic simulations to study the evolution of microstructure
during deformation and phase transformations.
