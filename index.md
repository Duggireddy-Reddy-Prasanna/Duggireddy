Hi! I am Arjun. 

I am a PhD candidate at the department of
 [Metallurgical Engg and Materials Science](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/) 
at IIT Bombay, working with [Prof. M P Gururajan](https://
sites.google.com/site/gurusofficialhomepage/) 
and [Prof. Prita Pant](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/
prof-prita-pant). 

My PhD thesis focuses on the study of the effect of dislocations 
on phase transformation phenomena using phase field simulations. 
Essentially, we study the effect of elastic interaction 
between dislocations and the solutes in a two-phase system leading 
to interesting kinds of phase separation. Apart from this, I also 
have experience working with first principle simulations from 
two different projects: (i) study of the effect of electron-phonon 
interactions in the total energy of semiconductors and (ii) 
study of Al addition on the lowering of stacking fault energy of 
Cu-Al system. 

I have also spent six months at [GPM2-SIMaP](https://simap.
grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/simap-directory-gpm2-group), 
Universit\{'e} Grenoble Alpes as a visiting doctoral fellow 
in [Prof. Marc Fivel's](https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr
/en/research/m-fivel-marc) research group. During this 
fellowship, I worked on an in-house discrete dislocation 
dynamics simulation package called [NUMODIS](https://www.researchgate.net/
project/3D-Discrete-Dislocation-Dynamics-Simulations), 
trying to develop an algorithm to model slip transfer.
We are also currently working on a method to integrate 
stress calculations using Fast Fourier transforms into 
discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.

Here, you will find details about my projects, 
links to publications, blog entries and a brief CV.
