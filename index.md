Hello there. You have reached Arjun's homepage. 

Arjun is a PhD candidate at the Department of Metallurgical 
Engineering and Materials Science at the Indian Institute of 
Technology Bombay. He uses computational techniques such as 
phase field modelling, discrete dislocation dynamics and 
atomistic simulations to study the evolution of microstructue 
during deformation and phase transformations.
