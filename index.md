Hi! I am Arjun. 

I am a PhD candidate at the department of
 [Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/) 
at IIT Bombay, working with [Prof. M P Gururajan](https://
sites.google.com/site/gurusofficialhomepage/) 
and [Prof. Prita Pant](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/
prof-prita-pant). 

My PhD thesis focuses on the study of the effect of dislocations 
on phase transformation phenomena using phase field simulations. 
Essentially, we study the effect of elastic interaction 
between dislocations and the solutes in a two-phase system leading 
to interesting phase transformation phenomena. We have also used 
the phase field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) code developed to look at 
the equilibrium stacking fault widths in different face-centered 
cubic alloy systems, where alloying results in the variation of 
stacking fault energy. Inputs from first-principle simulations 
are used to create a generalised stacking fault energy landscape 
which results in dislocation dissociation and creation of a 
stacking fault in the PFDD model. In addition, I was also 
involved in an ab-initio study of the effect of electron-phonon 
interactions on the total energy and hence, the stability of different 
semiconductor polymorphs.

As part of a visiting fellowship, I have spent six months 
at [GPM2-SIMaP](https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/simap-directory-gpm2-group), 
Universite Grenoble Alpes with [Prof. Marc Fivel's](https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr
/en/research/m-fivel-marc) research group. During this 
fellowship, I worked on an in-house discrete dislocation 
dynamics simulation package called [NUMODIS](https://www.researchgate.net/
project/3D-Discrete-Dislocation-Dynamics-Simulations), 
trying to develop an algorithm to model slip transfer.
We are also currently working on a method to integrate 
stress calculations using Fast Fourier transforms into 
discrete dislocation dynamics simulations.

Here, you will find details about my projects, 
links to publications, blog entries and a brief CV.
