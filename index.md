I work at the department of [Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/) 
at IIT Bombay, with [Prof. M P Gururajan](https://sites.google.com/site/gurusofficialhomepage/) 
and [Prof. Prita Pant](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/prof-prita-pant). 

My PhD thesis focuses on the study of the effect of dislocations 
on phase transformation phenomena using phase field simulations. 
Essentially, we study the effect of elastic interaction 
between dislocations and the solutes in a two-phase system leading 
to interesting phase transformation phenomena. 

We have also used the phase field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) code developed to look at 
the equilibrium stacking fault widths in different face-centered 
cubic alloy systems. The generalised stacking fault energy is incorporated from 
atomistic or density functional theory calculations performed by our collaborators 
at [Prof. Vaishali Shah](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vaishali-Shah-3)'s group in University of Pune. In addition, during the early 
years of my PhD, I was also part of an ab-initio study of the effect of 
electron-phonon interactions on the total energy and hence, the stability of different 
semiconductor polymorphs.

As part of an Overseas visiting doctoral fellowship (SERB-OVDF 2019), I have also spent 
six months at [GPM2-SIMaP](https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/simap-directory-gpm2-group), 
Universite Grenoble Alpes with [Prof. Marc Fivel's](https://simap.grenoble-inp.fr
/en/research/m-fivel-marc) research group. During this fellowship, I worked on an in-house 
discrete dislocation dynamics simulation package called 
[NUMODIS](https://www.researchgate.net/project/3D-Discrete-Dislocation-Dynamics-Simulations), 
trying to develop an algorithm to model slip transfer.

Here, you will find details about my projects, 
links to publications, blog entries and a brief CV. Thanks for visiting!
